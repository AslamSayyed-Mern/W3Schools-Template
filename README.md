# W3Schools-Template Clone
As part of my front-end development practice, I recreated a W3Schools homepage template using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on CSS Grid layout.

ðŸ”§ Key Concepts Used:

CSS Grid for responsive layout

Flexbox for content alignment

Custom styling & hover effects

ðŸ’¡ This project helped me deepen my understanding of layout systems and responsive design. It's a great exercise to sharpen my skills by replicating real-world designs.
